                                   <b> INCOME TAX RETURN </b> </p>
<p> Income Tax Return is the form in which assessee files information about his/her Income and tax thereon to Income Tax Department. Various forms are ITR 1, ITR 2, ITR 3, ITR 4, ITR 5, ITR 6 and ITR 7. When you file a belated return, you are not allowed to carry forward certain losses. </p>
<p> The Income Tax Act, 1961, and the Income Tax Rules, 1962, obligates citizens to file returns with the Income Tax Department at the end of every financial year. These returns should be filed before the specified due date. Every Income Tax Return Form is applicable to a certain section of the Assessees. Only those Forms which are filed by the eligible Assessees are processed by the Income Tax Department of India. It is therefore imperative to know which particular form is appropriate in each case. Income Tax Return Forms vary depending on the criteria of the source of income of the Assessee and the category of the Assessee. </p>
<p> </p> 
                              
<p> <b> Filing of income tax returns: obligation by law </b> </p>
<p>Individuals who fulfil any one of the following conditions should by law file their Income Tax Returns during a financial year. </p>

<p><b> GST – GODS AND SERVICES TAX </b></p>
<p> In the year 2000, the then Prime Minister introduced the concept of GST and set up a committee to design a GST model for the country. In 2003, the Central Government formed a taskforce on Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management, which in 2004 recommended GST to replace the existing tax regime by introducing a comprehensive tax on all goods and services replacing Central level VAT and State level VATs. It recommended replacing all indirect taxes except the customs duty with value added tax on all goods and services with complete set off in all stages of the value chain. </p>

<p> The movement towards GST was articulated by the then Union Finance Minister in his Budget speech for 2006-07. Initially, it was proposed that GST would be introduced from 1st April 2010.The Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers (EC) which had formulated the design of State VAT was requested to come up with a roadmap and structure for GST. Joint Working Groups of officials having representatives of the States as well as the Centre were set up to examine various aspects of GST and draw up reports specifically on exemptions and thresholds, taxation of services and taxation of inter-State supplies. Based on discussions within and between it and the Central Government, the EC released its First Discussion Paper (FDP) on the GST in November, 2009. This spelt out features of the proposed GST and has formed the basis for discussion between the Centre and the States so far. </p>

<p> The introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a very significant step in the field of indirect tax reforms in India. By amalgamating a large number of Central and State taxes into a single tax, GST will mitigate ill effects of cascading or double taxation in a major way and pave the way for a common national market. From the consumers point of view, the biggest advantage would be in terms of reduction in the overall tax burden on goods, which is currently estimated to be around 25%-30%. It would also imply that the actual burden of indirect taxes on goods and services would be much more transparent to the consumer. Introduction of GST would also make Indian products competitive in the domestic and international markets owing to the full neutralization of input taxes across the value chain of production and distribution. Studies show that this would have a boosting impact on economic growth. Last but not the least, this tax, because of its transparent and self-policing character, would be easier to administer. It would also encourage a shift from the informal to formal economy. The government proposes to introduce GST with effect from 1st July 2017. </p>

<p><b> Salient features of GST </b></p>
<p> (i)	GST is applicable on ‘supply’ of goods or services as against the present concept on the manufacture of goods or on sale of goods or on provision of services. </p>
<p> (ii)	GST is based on the principle of destination-based consumption taxation as against the present principle of origin-based taxation. </p>
<p> (iii)	It is a dual GST with the Centre and the States simultaneously levying tax on a common base. GST to be levied by the Centre would be called Central GST(CGST) and that to be levied by the States would be called State GST (SGST). </p>
<p> (iv)	An Integrated GST (IGST) would be levied an inter-state supply (including stock transfers) of goods or services. This shall be levied and collected by the Government of India and such tax shall be apportioned between the Union and the States in the manner as may be provided by Parliament by Law on the recommendation of the GST Council. </p>
<p> (v)	Import of goods or services would be treated as inter-state supplies and would be subject to IGST in addition to the applicable customs duties.</p>
<p> (vi)	 CGST, SGST & IGST would be levied at rates to be mutually agreed upon by the Centre and the States. The rates would be notified on the recommendation of the GST Council. In a recent meeting, the GST Council has decided that GST would be levied at four rates viz. 5%, 12%, 16% and 28%. The schedule or list of items that would fall under each of these slabs has been worked out. In addition to these rates, a cess would be imposed on “demerit” goods to raise resources for providing compensation to States as States may lose revenue owing to the implementation of GST.</p>
<p></p>
  
<p> (vii)	 GST would replace the following taxes currently levied and collected by the Centre:-
<p> a) Central Excise Duty 
<p> b) Duties of Excise (Medicinal and Toilet Preparations) </p>
<p> c) Additional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special Importance) </p>
<p> d) Additional Duties of Excise (Textiles and Textile Products) </p>
<p> e) Additional Duties of Customs (commonly known as CVD) </p>
<p> f) Special Additional Duty of Customs(SAD) </p>
<p> g) Service Tax </p>
<p> h) Cesses and surcharge in so far as they relate to supply of goods and services. </p>
 <p></p>
                              
<p> (viii)  State taxes that would be subsumed within the GST are:-</p>
<p> a) State VAT </p>
<p> b) Central Sates Tax </p>
<p> <p> c) Purchase Tax </p>
<p> <p> d) Luxury Tax </p>
<p> e) Entry Tax (All forms) </p>
<p> f) Entertainment Tax and Amusement Tax (except those levied by the local bodies) </p>
<p> g) Taxes on advertisements </p>
<p> h) Taxes on lotteries, betting and gambling </p>
<p> i) State cesses and surcharges in so far as they relate to supply of goods and services.</p>
 <p></p>
  
<p>  (ix) GST would apply on all goods and services except Alcohol for human consumption. </p>
<p>(x) GST on five specified petroleum products (Crude, Petrol, Diesel, ATF & Natural Gas) would by applicable from a date to be recommended by the GSTC. </p>
<p>(xi) Tobacco and tobacco products would be subject to GST. In addition, the Centre would have the power to levy Central Excise duty on these products. </p>
<p>(xii) A common threshold exemption would apply to both CGST and SGST. Tax payers with an annual turnover not exceeding Rs.20 lakh (Rs.10 Lakh for special category States) would be exempt from GST. For small taxpayers with an aggregate turnover in a financial year upto 50 lakhs, a composition scheme is available. Under the scheme a taxpayer shall pay tax as a percentage of his turnover in a State during the year without benefit of Input Tax Credit. This scheme will be optional. </p>
<p>(xiii) The list of exempted goods and services would be kept to a minimum and it would be harmonized for the Centre and the States as well as across States as far as possible. </p>
<p>(xiv) Exports would be zero-rated supplies. Thus, goods or services that are exported would not suffer input taxes or taxes on finished products. </p>
<p>(xv) Credit of CGST paid on inputs may be used only for paying CGST on the output and the credit of SGST paid on inputs may be used only for paying SGST. Input Tax Credit (ITC) of CGST cannot be used for payment of SGST and vice versa. In other words, the two streams of Input Tax Credit (ITC) cannot be cross-utilised, except in specified circumstances of inter-state supplies for payment of IGST. The credit would be permitted to be utilised in the following manner:-</p>
<p> a) ITC of CGST allowed for payment of CGST & IGST in that order,</p>
<p>  b) ITC of SGST allowed for payment of SGST & IGST in that order,</p>
<p>  c) ITC of IGST allowed for payment of IGST, CGST & SGST in that order.</p>
<p> </p>                             
<p> (xvi) Accounts would be settled periodically between the Centre and the States to ensure that the credit of SGST used for payment of IGST is transferred by the Exporting State to the Centre. Similarly, IGST used for payment of SGST would be transferred by the Centre to the Importing State. Further, the SGST portion of IGST collected on B2C supplies would also be transferred by the Centre to the destination State. The transfer of funds would be carried out on the basis of information contained in the returns filed by the taxpayers. </p>
<p> (xvii) The laws, regulations and procedures for levy and collection of CGST and SGST would be harmonized to the extent possible.</p>
<p>The whole GST system will be backed by a robust IT system. In this regard, Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) has been set up by the Government. It will provide front end services and will also develop back end IT modules for States who opted for the same.</p>
