                                   Cyber law is the part of the overall legal system that deals with the Internet, cyberspace, and their respective legal issues. Cyber law covers a fairly broad area, encompassing several subtopics including freedom of expression, access to and usage of the Internet, and online privacy. Generically, cyber law is referred to as the Law of the Internet. </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The first cyber law was the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, enacted in 1986. Known as CFAA, this law prohibits unauthorized access to computers and includes detail about the levels of punishment for breaking that law. </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Cyber law, also known as cyber crime law, is legislation focused on the acceptable behavioral use of technology including computer hardware and software, the internet, and networks. Cyber law helps protect users from harm by enabling the investigation and prosecution of online criminal activity. It applies to the actions of individuals, groups, the public, government, and private organizations. </p> 
<p>Cyber crimes include fraud, forgery, money laundering, theft, and other illegal activities performed via computer hardware and software, the internet, and networks. Cyber law investigates crimes perpetrated in the physical world but enabled in cyberspace. For example, organized crime syndicates using the internet to distribute illegal substances may face prosecution under cyber laws. In business, cyber law protects companies from unlawful access and theft of their intellectual property. </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>While cyber crime impacts the global community, the adoption of cyber crime legislation varies among countries. Seventy-two percent of countries have cyber laws, 9% have draft legislation, and 18% have no cyber laws, according to 2019 data from the United Nations. Many states develop new cyber laws as addenda to their current codes. Some countries amend their existing national codes with legislative language on cyber crime. </p> 
<p>Cyber laws help to reduce or prevent people from cybercriminal activities on a large scale with the help of protecting information access from unauthorized people, freedom of speech related to the use of the Internet, privacy, communications, email, websites, intellectual property, hardware and software, such as data storage devices. As Internet traffic is increasing rapidly day by day, that has led to a higher percentage of legal issues worldwide. Because cyber laws are different according to the country and jurisdiction, restitution ranges from fines to imprisonment, and enforcement is challenging. </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Cyberlaw offers legal protections for people who are using the Internet as well as running an online business. It is most important for Internet users to know about the local area and cyber law of their country by which they could know what activities are legal or not on the network. Also, they can prevent ourselves from unauthorized activities. </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act was the first cyber law, called CFFA, that was enacted in 1986. This law was helpful in preventing unauthorized access to computers. And it also provided a description of the stages of punishment for breaking that law or performing any illegal activity. </p> 
  <p> </p> 
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                 
<p> <b> NEED </b> </p>
 <p> There are many security issues with using the Internet and also available different malicious people who try to unauthorized access your computer system to perform potential fraud. Therefore, similarly, any law, cyber law is created to protect online organizations and people on the network from unauthorized access and malicious people. If someone does any illegal activity or breaks the cyber rule, it offers people or organizations to have that persons sentenced to punishment or take action against them. </p>          
<p> </p>                 
  
                              
<p> <b> IMPORTANCE </b> </p>                              
 <p> Cyber laws are formed to punish people who perform any illegal activities online. They are important to punish related to these types of issues such as online harassment, attacking another website or individual, data theft, disrupting the online workflow of any enterprise and other illegal activities.</p> 

<p>If anyone breaks a cyber law, the action would be taken against that person on the basis of the type of cyberlaw he broke, where he lives, and where he broke the law. It is most important to punish the criminals or to bring them to behind bars, as most of the cybercrimes cross the limit of crime that cannot be considered as a common crime.</p> 

<p>These crimes may be very harmful for losing the reliability and confidentiality of personal information or a nation. Therefore, these issues must be handled according to the laws.</p> 

<p>When users apply transactions on the Internet, cyber law covers every transaction and protect them.</p> 
<p>It touches every reaction and action in cyberspace.</p> 
<p>It captures all activities on the Internet.</p>
