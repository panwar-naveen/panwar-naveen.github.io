			The court in the matter of "Ashish Rai vs State" had held that although the recovered substance falls under the commercial quantity which attracts the stringent condition prescribed under section 37 however the Court categorically stated that we are considering the ground for bail as lack of vediographic evidence and absence of independent witnesses thus the court inclined to grant bail

			The Court in the matter of "Mohd Shariq vs State" had observed that in the absence of any medical evidence against the accused it would be difficult to attract the provisions of POCSO Act. Further the court held that the physical alliance between the accused and prosecutirx though conventionally unholy, clearly lacks any element of perversion, abhorrence or odiousness. Considering the above and other relevant facts and circumstances of the case, regular bail was granted to the accused.

The Court further clarified that the intent of the legislature was never to criminalize romantic relationships. Considering the same and also the fact that the family of the prosecutrix was embarrassed by the pregnancy of the prosecutrix and made her file the present case the accused was released on regular bail.

Further the court was doubtful as to why always the passbys are asked to become independent witness and no government officials or shopkeepers whose availability would rather be more easier at a place like Metro Station. Hence the accused has been released on regular bail for non-joining of independent witness, No photography and no videography.

			The Hon'ble High Court in the matter of "Bilal vs State" had held that prosecution should establish the link/ connectivity among the accused persons to attract the provisions of conspiracy. The recovery from the instant applicant was an intermediate quantity. Interestingly, after clubbing the quantity with the co-accused then only it would be converted into commercial quantity. Moreover, the ingredients of conspiracy would be merely satisfied once the evidences examined meticulously. Resultantly, there is no evidence available except the recovery which demonstrates that they are in connivance with each other.

				The Court in the matter of "Babu Roy vs State" had held that it is relevant to note that period of incarceration in itself sufficient for consideration to release the accused on regular bail. On the other side each passing day inside the jail could be count as change in circumstance. Noteworthy, the Apex Court had enunciated certain principles/directives which inter alia provide that if an undertrial is charged for an offence under the NDPS Act punishable and the trial is delayed and the accused has already undergone almost half of the sentence prescribed (or the minimum if there is a range provided) then he should be entitled for being released on bail subject to conditions.
